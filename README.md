## CY P06 24 06 - Spatial Distribution - BIB Breathes

By understanding how health problems are distributed across a city, we can identify areas where more people are suffering from poor health. When we combine this information with maps showing the distribution of environmental factors or deprivation, we can use this information to help develop research questions to better understand how the environment might affect health.


Understanding the spatial distribution and patterning of health can help identify disparities by distinguishing areas of need where there are greater numbers of individuals living with ill-health. Together, with maps of environmental indicators or the index of multiple deprivation (IMD), these maps can help develop research questions as to how the environment may impact on health.

This project will use routinely collected Health data with publicly available data on deprivation and air pollution.
